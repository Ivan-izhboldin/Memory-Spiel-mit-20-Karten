# 🧠 Memory Game with 20 Cards (Memory-Spiel mit 20 Karten)

## 🌟 Project Overview

This is a classic web-based memory matching game, built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective is simple: find all 10 matching pairs of cards in the shortest number of moves possible.

The project is designed to be fully responsive and includes basic tracking of the number of moves made and a reset function to start a new game instantly.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1.  **Start:** The game board displays 20 face-down cards.
2.  **Match:** Click on any two cards to reveal their symbols.
3.  **Find Pairs:** If the symbols match, the cards remain face-up. If they do not match, they flip back over after a short delay.
4.  **Win:** The game ends when all 10 pairs have been successfully matched.
5.  **Tracking:** Keep an eye on the "Moves" counter to track your efficiency!

## 💻 Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Structure and content of the game.
